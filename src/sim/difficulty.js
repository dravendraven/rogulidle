// How hard a floor is, from one number: how many creatures are on it.

// Everything else follows by formula. There is no calibration table, no
// measured win-rate curve, no interpolation between anchors — those all
// went stale every time a mechanic changed, and every one of them did.
//
// WHY COUNT IS THE RIGHT DIAL
//
// The cost of clearing a roster tracks `sum of hp × (xp − 1)` almost
// exactly. Measured against the real duel maths:
//
//   roster              sum xp   hp×(xp−1)   cost
//   3 ghosts (xp 3)        9         18      5.85
//   6 rats   (xp 1)        6          0      0.00
//   1 genie  (xp 6)        6         50     20.63
//   1 dragon (xp 8)        8        105     44.63
//
// Note that summing xp predicts nothing: six rats and one genie both total
// 6, and one costs nothing while the other costs twenty. A strong monster
// hits harder AND lasts longer, and those multiply — so individual strength
// scales cost quadratically while COUNT scales it linearly.
//
// Linear is what you want in a dial. Doubling the creatures doubles the
// demand, predictably, with no thresholds to fall off.

// at exactly the same rate as threat, and since the hero ACCUMULATES while
// each floor's threat is spent once, the hero wins. Measured that way, the
